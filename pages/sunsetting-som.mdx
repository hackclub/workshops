**Make something amazing this summer.** At its core, that’s what Summer of Making was. We were there to support Hack Clubbers, but it was them who made this summer special. We [set a challenge](https://summer.hackclub.com/landing) and makers from 129 countries took it on!

The most prominent way we supported making came through funding $50,000 worth of hardware projects, thanks to the gracious support of Github, Adafruit, and Arduino. We sent 1,595 shopping carts’ worth of hardware to 270 makers, the average age of whom was 16. You can see many of [their making journeys on Scrapbook](http://scrapbook.hackclub.com/r/hardware).

Meanwhile, 360 Hack Clubbers shared 3,500 unique creations on [Scrapbook](https://scrapbook.hackclub.com/), a place for sharing project updates with the Hack Club community. It kept streaks, like Snapchat, and one of you posted for 45 consecutive days! (If you’re interested, [Lachlan](https://scrapbook.hackclub.com/lachlanjc) [wrote about how Scrapbook works here](http://notebook.lachlanjc.com/2020-07-30_how_scrapbook_works/).)

Beyond Scrapbook & our hardware grants, so much more happened this summer. We ran [AMAs](https://hackclub.com/amas/)—[chatting](https://youtu.be/DvROZ-OBszU) [with](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWFtj9cCaB0) [six](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fDKYjX37cbo) [absolutely](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tDtBCcLJ2xU&list=PLbNbddgD-XxFFLLLaODUtif9v99eFXub3) [remarkable](https://youtu.be/thXsjHVcxx4) [guests](https://youtu.be/KKEYTSUvsS8)—the Scrapbook CSS contest, Open Source Fiesta, a chess tournament, 50-person, two-week scavenger hunt on Slack, and weekly [Hack Nights](https://hackclub.com/night/). Personally, I learned Next.js, MDX, & Theme UI to make [this recap site](https://summer.hackclub.com/) of the summer.

**Today (August 31st) we’re drawing the Summer of Making to a close. Where do we go from here?**

## Hardware

Through the summer, we’ve grown a substantial community of hardware hackers on the Slack and we want to keep the spirit alive. To celebrate the wonderful summer we’ve had, we’ll be shipping out custom, Orpheus-themed Arduino Leonardos, which we’ve named the Orpheus Leap. We’ll also be hosting a show & tell with Adafruit & the wonderful [John Park](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Edgar_Park).

We’ve sent everyone who received a hardware grant a message on the [Hack Club Slack](https://hackclub.com/slack/) (via Orpheus) on redeeming their Orpheus Leap. If you didn’t get/apply for a hardware grant, it’s open to everyone to everyone in the community—[fill out this form](https://hack.af/orpheus-leap) and we’ll send one over! Shoutout to Kevin Yang for desiging this marvelous PCB.

More details will be shared about the Adafruit Show & Tell in the next few weeks.

## Community

Today we’ve archived all the SoM channels (those prefixed with `#som-`), to shift conversation into the standard Slack channels like `#lounge`, `#code`, and `#welcome`. We’ve kept `#hardware-party` and its affiliated channels open for now, since we’re still shipping out the final grants & want to continue support as folks complete their projects. In the future, we’ll redirect folks to `#hardware`.

A handful of folks are yet to be promoted. We’ll be finding many of you who are active on Scrapbook & promoting you, but message anyone on `@summer` if you need a promotion.

**New users:** We’ve redesigned the flow for joining the Slack, the aim being to make it more sustainable. [DETAILS]

**Stickers:** They’re coming. Hang tight.

**Scrapbook:** While originally Scrapbook was merely a summer project, shutting it down didn’t feel right. Thanks to [Caleb](https://scrapbook.hackclub.com/caleb), today we’re launching **“Scrapbook from Anywhere”**. Whenever you post in a public channel, you can add a `:scrappy:` emoji reaction & your post will be added to your Scrapbook. We’ve added this to help Scrapbook mix with the rest of Slack more, and while the `#scrapbook` channel will remain as-is, it allows you to Scrapbook `#ship`s, get feedback in `#design` or `#wip`, show off your photo in `#photography`, or share with your club without cross-posting.

In summary, thank you: to everyone who helped run parts of the Summer, who made a Scrapbook post, built something epic with a hardware grant, attended a live event or just dropped by on the Slack. I posted a starting idea in `#hq` last spring, and it’s been an experience of a lifetime watching it come together. You all made the summer amazing!

With gratitude,

Sam Poder, the Summer of Making team, & Hack Club HQ
