**Make something amazing this summer.** At its core, that’s what Summer of Making was. We were there to support Hack Clubbers, but it was them who made this summer special. We [set a challenge](https://summer.hackclub.com/landing) and makers from 129 countries took it on!

The most prominent way we supported making came through funding $50,000 worth of hardware projects, thanks to the gracious support of Github, Adafruit, and Arduino. We sent 1,950 shopping carts’ worth of hardware to 268 makers, the average age of whom was 16. You can see many of [their making journeys on Scrapbook](http://scrapbook.hackclub.com/r/hardware).

Did someone mention Scrapbook? 414 Hack Clubbers shared 5,628 unique creations on [Scrapbook](https://scrapbook.hackclub.com/), a place for sharing project updates with the Hack Club community. It kept Snapchat-like streaks, and one of you posted for 74 consecutive days! (If you’re interested, <StaticMention username="lachlanjc" avatar="https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/6a8e07714d446b0dbc70209ac77b2453/8e93fe10" link="https://scrapbook.hackclub.com/lachlanjc" /> [wrote about how Scrapbook works](http://notebook.lachlanjc.com/2020-07-30_how_scrapbook_works/).)

Beyond Scrapbook & our hardware grants, so much more happened this summer. We ran [AMAs](https://hackclub.com/amas/)—[chatting](https://youtu.be/DvROZ-OBszU) [with](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWFtj9cCaB0) [six](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fDKYjX37cbo) [absolutely](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tDtBCcLJ2xU&list=PLbNbddgD-XxFFLLLaODUtif9v99eFXub3) [remarkable](https://youtu.be/thXsjHVcxx4) [guests](https://youtu.be/KKEYTSUvsS8)—the Scrapbook CSS contest, the first ever Hack Club CTF, Open Source Fiesta, a chess tournament, a scavenger hunt on Slack, and weekly [Hack Nights](https://hackclub.com/night/). Personally, I learned Next.js, MDX, & Theme UI to make [a recap site, which is now Hack Club’s homepage](https://summer.hackclub.com/).

### Today (August 31st) we’re drawing the Summer of Making to a close. Here’s what’s next.

## Hardware

Through the summer, we’ve grown a substantial community of hardware hackers on the Slack and we want to keep the spirit alive. To celebrate the wonderful summer we’ve had, **we’ll be shipping custom, Orpheus-themed Arduino Leonardos**, which we’ve named the [Orpheus Leap](https://leap.hackclub.com). These are fully-functional computers, packed into a dino shape, shipped for free.

![Orpheus Leap PCB](http://cloud-jrox24mrn.vercel.app/orpheus_leap_micro_final.png)

We’ve sent everyone who received a hardware grant a message on the [Hack Club Slack](https://hackclub.com/slack/) (via Orpheus) on redeeming their Orpheus Leap. If you didn’t get/apply for a hardware grant, it’s nonetheless open to everyone to everyone in the community—[fill out this form](https://hack.af/orpheus-leap) and we’ll send one over! Shoutout to <StaticMention username="kevinyang" avatar="https://ca.slack-edge.com/T0266FRGM-U015X5P6KAM-gc35567f1dbb-512" link="http://bykevinyang.com/"/> (a Hack Clubber from MA) for designing this marvelous PCB.

We’ll also be hosting a show & tell with Adafruit & the wonderful [John Park](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Edgar_Park). More details will be shared in the next few weeks.

## Community

Today we’ve archived all the SoM channels (those prefixed with `#som-`), to shift conversation into the standard Slack channels like `#lounge`, `#code`, and `#welcome`. We’ve kept `#hardware-party` and its affiliated channels open for now, since we’re still shipping out the final grants & want to continue support as folks complete their projects. In the future, we’ll redirect folks to `#hardware`.

A handful of folks are yet to be promoted. We’ll be finding many of you who are active on Scrapbook & promoting you, but message anyone on `@summer` if you need a promotion.

**New users:** We’ve redesigned the flow for joining the Slack. New users now join as multi-channel guests, added only to #welcome and a private channel where they’re introduced to the Slack. Once they complete the tutorial, they’re automatically promoted to full users & unlock the rest of the community.

**Stickers:** Everyone who filled out the form at <https://hack.af/som-stickers> will receive stickers in the upcoming weeks! Hang tight.

## Scrapbook

![Default Scrapbook on a MacBook Air](http://cloud-egtwyjtcv.vercel.app/untitled_design-6.png)

While originally Scrapbook was merely a summer project, shutting it down didn’t feel right. Thanks to <StaticMention username="caleb" avatar="http://github.com/cjdenio.png" link="https://scrapbook.hackclub.com/caleb" />, today we’re launching **“Scrapbook from Anywhere”**. When you post in a public channel with the Scrappy bot, add a `:scrappy:` emoji reaction & your message will be posted to your Scrapbook. We’ve added this to help Scrapbook mix with the rest of Slack more, and while the `#scrapbook` channel will remain as-is, it allows you to Scrapbook the projects you `#ship`, get feedback in `#design` or `#wip`, show off your photo in `#photography`, or share with your club without cross-posting.

***

In summary, thank you—to everyone who helped run parts of the Summer, who made a Scrapbook post, built something epic with a hardware grant, attended a live event or just dropped by on the Slack. I posted a starting idea in `#hq` in May, and it’s been an experience of a lifetime helping put it together. You all made the summer amazing!

With gratitude,

Sam Poder, the Summer of Making team, & Hack Club HQ
