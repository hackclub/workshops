**Make something amazing this summer.** At core, that’s what Summer of Making was. We were there to support Hack Clubbers, but it was them who made this summer special. We set a challenge and makers from all over the world (129 countries) took it on! 

360 Hack Clubbers shared 3500 unique creations on [Scrapbook](https://scrapbook.hackclub.com), a platform for sharing updates on the project you're working on with the community. It kept streaks (just like Snapchat), the highest streak was 45! If you’re interested, you can also learn more about how Scrapbook works [here](http://notebook.lachlanjc.com/2020-07-30_how_scrapbook_works/).

The most prominent way that we supported was by funding $50,000 worth of hardware projects, thanks to the gracious support of Github, Adafruit and Arduino. With this we were able to support 270 makers in creating the projects of their dreams. You can follow along with many of their journeys on [this page](http://scrapbook.hackclub.com/r/hardware).

There’s so much more that happened throughout the summer. You can relive it all on [this recap site](https:) I made using Next.js with MDX, Theme UI, & the Hack Club Theme. It’s my first site made using these technologies, so feel free to shoot me a DM with feedback!

**If you haven’t already got it, today (August 31st) we’re drawing the Summer of Making to a close. Here’s how we’re moving forward….**

### Looking forward

Over the summer we’ve brought in thousands of new community members, built much loved programs like #scrapbook and a whole new sub-community of hardware hackers! So where do we go from here?

**Hardware:** Through the summer, we’ve grown a substantial community of hardware hackers on the Slack and we want to keep the spirit alive! To celebrate all the wonderful summer we’ve had, we’ll be shipping out custom Orpheus themed Arduino Leonardos (named the Orpheus Leap). We’ll also be hosting a show and tell with Adafruit & the wonderful [John Park](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Edgar_Park).

<br />

Everyone who received a hardware grant has got a message on the Hack Club Slack through Orpheus detailing how they can redeem their Orpheus Leap. We also wanted to open this up to everyone to everyone in the community, feel free to fill out [this form](https://hack.af/orpheus-leap) and we’ll send one over! Shoutout to Kevin Yang for desiging this marvelous PCB.

More details will be shared about the Adafruit Show & Tell in the next few weeks.

**Community:** Today we’ve archived all of the SoM channels (those prefixed with `#som-`), we hope for the conversation to shift into the standard Slack channels like`#lounge`,`#code`, and`#welcome`. We’ve kept`#hardware-party`and it’s affiliated channels open for now, this will allow us to continue providing support to hardware grant receivers. At an undefined point in time however, we will be closing those channels and bringing people into`#hardware`<span style={{ marginLeft: '-4px'}}>.</span> 

We recognize that there are some people who are yet to be promoted from the SoM channels. We’ll be automatically finding all all users who have posted 3 times in Scrapbook or within the last week and promoting them. If anyone who doesn’t meet this criteria, shoot anyone on`@summer`or`@staff`a message and we can help you out!

**New Users:** We’ve redesigned the flow for joining the Slack, the aim being to make it more sustainable. [DETAILS]

**Scrapbook:** We’ve seen the value that Scrapbook has brought to the community and want to keep that spirit alive! We’re launching a feature called “Scrapbook from anywhere”. Scrapbook from anywhere allows you to post in any public channel, add a`:scrappy:`emoji reaction & your post will be added to your Scrapbook. We’ve created this system to help Scrapbook mix with the rest of Slack more. The`#scrapbook`channel will stay just the same and hopefully we’ll have great pictures of clubs in the new school year!

**Stickers:** They’re coming. Hang tight.

To end, thank you. Thank you to everyone who helped run parts of the summer, who made a scrapbook post,  built something epic with a hardware grant, attended a live event or just dropped by on the Slack! Together, you all made the summer amazing!

Thanks, 

Sam Poder & the Summer of Making team.
