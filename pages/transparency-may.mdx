Inspired by [Drew DeVault](https://drewdevault.com/2020/05/15/Status-update.html), this is the first of what will hopefully be many financial snapshots of Hack Club’s spending.

This was calculated from HQ’s export from Hack Club Bank. You can see our full current account at https://bank.hackclub.com/hq/ using Hack Club Bank’s new [Transparency Mode](https://twitter.com/hackclub/status/1262471150963130374).

The following numbers are on a cash basis, meaning they only include transactions that hit our bank account or cards this month. In some cases, there are expenses that we have committed to in May that have not yet hit our accounts, like rent for the space that the team is currently staying in. They also don't include potential transactions from today, the 30th, or the 31st of this month that have not gone through yet.

I've done my best to include as many committed transactions that have not yet hit our accounts at the bottom of the expense breakdown, including [Elon Musk’s $500K gift to Hack Club](https://twitter.com/hackclub/status/1263153557945159680).

Without further ado, here’s a financial snapshot for Hack Club in May 2020:

Please note: there may be errors in this post. While I have pulled the numbers directly from Hack Club Bank, I did mess around a bit in a spreadsheet and have not double checked my work. I believe that all numbers below are approximately correct.

If you're interested in seeing the Google Sheet I used to calculate the above numbers, you can see it at https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1UDw7YewsS5wJIVm0Uh5wOGlM2Ddv-kZVrD3QqIypvRQ/edit.

Please note that while the above encompasses all of HQ’s spending, it does not include GitHub grants to clubs, postage bought by Mail Team, or grants made from our internal "Discretionary Fund" to students in need that is funded by Ron Conway.
