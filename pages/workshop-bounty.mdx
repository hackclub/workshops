The hardest part of running a good Hack Club is running good meetings. This semester, we're inviting every Hack Club leader to create a library of easy-to-run Hack Club workshops together.

Here's how it works: contribute a workshop to <https://workshops.hackclub.com>, we pay you $200. You could write workshops instead of a part-time job for personal income. Or you could write workshops to fundraise for your club.

Starting out, we expect only 1 in 20 accepted workshops to be top-notch. As the weeks go on, we'll be iterating on the approval requirements to raise that number.

Great workshops have a 10-20 minute core demo, are very visual, and have clear paths for hacking. We think there are broadly two ways to learn to code: by the textbook vs. learning like a hacker. Hack Club workshops are to help clubs inspire their members to learn like hackers - solving the motivation problem, not the explanation problem.

[Sound Galaxy](https://workshops.hackclub.com/sound_galaxy/) is an example of a good workshop. It's short, produces a very visual demo, and has clear paths to continue hacking. Hear [@matthew](https://matthewstanciu.me/)'s thoughts:

The workshop format is flexible. You could make a Markdown document, a slideshow, an interactive MDX file, a static website, or something else entirely. Push the format!

Approval requirements:

- You must submit your final workshop to [hackclub/hackclub](https://github.com/hackclub/hackclub) on GitHub
- Workshops should have very visual 10-20 minute core "demo" and 4-6 examples of what different people could turn it into during the hacking period
- Images and visuals must be included
- Any assets (images / PDFs / any other binaries) must be hosted using the `#cdn` channel on the Hack Club Slack
- All workshops must be in English at native-level proficiency. Phrasing and grammar must be perfect.
- You must be either a registered Hack Club leader or an active member of the Slack

We are a very small team. We will not be able to provide detailed editing and feedback on submissions. If any of the above requirements are not hit, we will reject and you can resubmit once you've made changes.

How to get paid:

- Total payment: $200 USD
- Available payment methods for US citizens:
  - Mailed check. You must be able to sign [Form W-9](https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/fw9.pdf) (this is a standard tax document that the IRS forces Hack Club to collect - don't worry, we have a flow for collecting electronic signatures).
  - Receiving funds in a [Hack Club Bank](https://hackclub.com/bank) account (ex. if you want the funds to be structured as a grant to your Hack Club or your hackathon / nonprofit)
- Non-US citizens must have a PayPal account we can send funds to and be able to provide a signed [Form W-8BEN](https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/fw8ben.pdf) certifying that they are not subject to US tax law

We process payment within 7 days of workshops being accepted. You will receive a screenshot confirmation of payment once it's been made. Checks can take up to 2 weeks to arrive.

### Conversation with Matthew on his club and workshops

_2:59 PM on Thursday, September 3rd, 2020_

**What makes a good Hack Club meeting?**

A lot of it is the leader. The leader has to provide the energy and make sure people are having fun. It is important that people learn stuff, but it may be even more important that people have fun than actually learn stuff. That doesn't mean people shouldn't learn stuff, just that it's really important they have a good time. One of the best ways to make sure people have a good time is to have them making some real while having fun.

**You ran your Hack Club for 4 years. You mentioned that when you were a freshman and starting out, it was bad. Only later in your junior and senior years you feel like you "cracked" the format and started consistently running good meetings that had regular high attendance. What was the difference between your club when it was bad vs. good?**

When it was bad, we mostly did nothing. During meetings, I would say: "OK, everyone can do whatever they want. Let me know if you need help thinking of a project." But really people just got lost and nobody asked for help. I was also working on my own projects during club meetings, which a lot of club leaders do. I thought that would inspire my members to build projects of their own, but in retrospect I think it just made me less approachable.

As soon as I stopped working on my own projects and got up and spent the whole meeting walking around the room, being energetic, checking in, and asking people if they needed help, I could feel a huge difference. Truly nobody in your club is going to ask for help, especially if they think you're busy. Admitting they need help makes them feel weird because they feel like they're bothering you. You have to check in with your members if you want them to ask you for help.

My Hack Club actually became good when I was running content every week. Because there wasn't good content available via the Hack Club workshops, I started writing my own workshops each week for club meetings.

**What was the difference between the bad and the good workshops you made?**

Usually the bad workshops, well - none were really bad - but the worst ones were the ones where the end result wasn't very satisfying or people had to spend too much time writing too much code that they didn't understand to get something tangible.

The best ones were where the end product was something really, really cool, visually appealing, and made in 10 or 20 minutes. Also, the best ones had 5 examples right out of the gate of how other people have hacked it. Then people would do the workshop and at the end everyone would end up with something different.

For members, good workshops take very little time and effort to produce something very visually appealing and very hackable. And there are inspiring examples of how the workshop could be further hacked.

A lot of the old Hack Club workshops felt more like tutorials than workshops. Because people spent 45 minutes going through the tutorial and then making something that they didn't feel very satisfied by. Synth was the best workshop not made by me because it was very satisfying, but even it took an hour to do and that was too long for a good club meeting.

My favorite workshop I've made is Sound Galaxy. Most people, especially beginners, don't know that it's actually possible to take input from your microphone and turn it into colorful blops that show up on the screen with input from your microphone. And it's even more impressive you can do that as a complete beginner and newbie in 40-50 lines of code. Every member I've seen do that workshop was very impressed that it was possible to make something so cool that they didn't even know was possible in such a short amount of time.
